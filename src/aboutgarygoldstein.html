 		<p>It was 1968. I was a hippie -- a long-haired, fresh-faced, eternal optimist and die-hard romantic producing all the concerts for the 40,000 student campus. In the midst of this roiling sea of energy that was devoted to ending a war, unseating a president and saving the world, I was bringing Joni Mitchell and the poet laureates of the day to our campus to light the way with their music.  Music was my first love.</p>

<p>Then came law school, driven by my dream to follow in the footsteps of the great defense lawyers of the day – gifted orators, self-anointed champions of the underdog, seekers of truth and justice. A brilliant chapter, my temperament was not that of a defense lawyer, so I left San Francsico and the law to follow my passion for story and storytelling in a far different context… the filmmaking world of Hollywood.  Off to Los Angeles I went.</p>

<p>A far better fit, I spent the early years discovering, managing, nurturing and launching careers for little known writers and directors in film and tv. I soon grew hungry to be on the frontlines, to make films and not merely represent talent. So after producing several low-budget films, I found my way to producing major studio films like Pretty Woman, Under Siege or The Mothman Prophecies that continue to travel the world.</p>

<p>Yet underneath all my creative pursuits, there was an itch. A sense there’s something more, something outside the Hollywood beltway, a bigger play, a more essential way, as Steve Jobs would say, to make my dent.  To change the world and help those who need help. </p>

<p>When I met Linda Cruse, we immediately sensed shared values, passions and sense of purpose. Solving problems and rebuilding sustainable economies for devastated communities across the third world -- with less capital, greater speed, a more entrepreneurial and joyful approach than typifies NGO or charity-backed short-term relief efforts – was “it”. Catnip. A way to travel the world, be of service, do good, capture and tell unimaginable stories that deserve to be heard.  </p>

<p>Uplifting challenged communities and changing lives for generations to come is, for me, an irresistible and compelling story or, as George Bernard Shaw would say: “This is the true joy in life, the being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one.” </p>

<p>A new chapter, a bigger picture… onward !</p>
