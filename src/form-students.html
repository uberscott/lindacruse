        <h1>PRE-COMPETITION ENTRY FORM - STUDENTS</h1>
        <p>The Race 4 Good invites the brightest and best brains from business and universities, forms them
          into dynamic teams and harnesses their collective experience, innovation, passion and entrepreneurial acumen.  Teams are of 10 people comprising 5 business leaders and 5 students are challenged to solve some of the worldâ€™s seemingly intractable problems. A total of 10 teams will compete in the competition and two teams will be selected as winners. </p>
        <p>Teams are given 21 days in which to research the challenges facing a specific community in a third world country and to develop a business plan which, if implemented, would bring long-term, sustainable economic and social uplift to that area and transform lives.</p>
        <p>The two business plans considered the most likely to have the greatest long-term, sustainable and
          positive economic impact on a community, are chosen as overall winners.  Students from the
          winning teams are flown to Nepal to meet the community and see their projects come to life.</p>
